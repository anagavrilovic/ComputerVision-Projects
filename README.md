# Computer Vision Projects #
This repository contains four mini projects for senior year course Soft Computing (focused on Computer Vision) on Faculty of Technical Sciences
     
     
## 1. Car Counting
- First project using OpenCV library for image processing
- Counting cars on an image of a parking lot from a birds perspective using only image processing with OpenCV
- Learned concepts like binarization of image (global threshold, Otsu threshold, adaptive threshold, binarization based on HSV values), erosion, dilatation, opening, closing, finding useful contours

## 2. Captcha Reading
- OpenCV for image preprocessing for extracting text from the image
- Connecting hooks and dashes with the corresponding letters
- Preparation for the neural network by transforming the image into a vector
- Training neural network (using Keras library for implementing neural network)
- Preprocessing and prediction of test images

## 3. Emotion Recognition
- Image classification using HOG and SVM (scikit-learn library)
- Using Dlib for detection of characteristic points of the face
- Classification of 6 emotions: contempt, anger, disgust, neutral, happiness, surprise

## 4. Reading Halfstructured Documents
- OpenCV for image preprocessing for extracting ID cards and text from the image
- Using Tesseract OCR for reading text from the image
- Postprocessing results from Tesseract to match corresponding data of ID card for three types of cards
