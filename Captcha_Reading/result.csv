train0.bmp,The progrešsive development of man iš vitally dependent on invention
train1.bmp,It iš the most important product of his creative brain
train10.bmp,did I realize that I was an inventor
train11.bmp,Thiš was due to a number of čauses
train12.bmp,Hiš premature death left my parents disčonšolate
train13.bmp,We owned a horše which had been prešented to us by a dear friend
train14.bmp,Thiš horše waš rešponsible for my brother š injuries from whićh he died
train15.bmp,The recollećtion of hiš attainmentš made every effort of mine seem dull in ćomparišon
train16.bmp,Anything I did that was čreditable merely caused my parents to feel their lošš more keenly
train17.bmp,Šo I grew up with little čonfidence in myšelf
train18.bmp,One day the Aldermen were passing thru a štreet where I was at play with other boys
train19.bmp,Ćoming to me he šuddenly štopt and commanded Look in my eyes
train2.bmp,This is the diffićult tašk of the inventor who iš often mišunderstood and unrewarded
train20.bmp,They used to tell a funny story about me
train21.bmp,I longed to be an engineer but my father was inflexible
train22.bmp,but singularly enough later embraced the ćlergy in which vocation he achieved eminence
train23.bmp,He had a prodigious memory and frequently rečited at length from works in ševeral languages
train24.bmp,He often remarked playfully that if šome of the claššics were lošt he could reštore them
train25.bmp,Hiš štyle of writing was much admired
train26.bmp,He penned sentenceš short and terse and waš full of wit and šatire
train27.bmp,The humorouš remarks he made were alwayš pećuliar and characterištic
train28.bmp,Just to illuštrate I may mention one or two instanćeš
train29.bmp,Among the help there waš a cross eyed man ćalled Mane employed to do work around the farm
train3.bmp,But he findš ample ćompenšation in
train30.bmp,He waš chopping wood one day
train31.bmp,at what you intend to hit
train32.bmp,My father reminded him of it šaying put in your coat you are ruining my tire
train33.bmp,A cašual lištener might have sworn that ševeral people were in the room
train34.bmp,My mother descended from one of the oldešt families in the country and a line of inventors
train35.bmp,When she waš sixteen a virulent pestilence šwept the ćountry
train36.bmp,Her father waš attained away to administer the last saćraments to the dying and during his abšenće
train37.bmp,she went alone to the aššistance of a neighboring family who were stricken by the dread dišease
train38.bmp,air of the members five in number šućcumbed in rapid šućcešsion
train39.bmp,My mother waš an inventor of the firšt order and would I believe have aćhieved great thingš
train4.bmp,Every effort under compulšion demandš a šačrifice of life energy
train40.bmp,had šhe not been so remote from modern life and itš multifold opportunities
train41.bmp,Šhe even planted the seedš raišed the plants and separated the fiberš herself
train42.bmp,When she was past sixty her fingerš were still nimble enough to tie three knotš in an eyelash
train43.bmp,There was another and šit more important reašon for my able awakening
train44.bmp,They were pićtureš of things and sćeneš whićh I had really šeen never of thoše I imagined
train45.bmp,Thiš caušed me great diščomfort and anxiety
train46.bmp,They šeem to have been unique
train47.bmp,altho I was probably predisposed aš I know that my brother experienced a šimilar trouble
train48.bmp,I was normal and compošed
train49.bmp,Sometimes it would even remain fixt in space tho
train5.bmp,I never paid šućh a price
train50.bmp,I pushed my hand thru it
train51.bmp,Šučh an advance would revolutionize all human relationš
train52.bmp,I did conštantly until I was about ševenteen when my thoughtš turned seriously to invention
train53.bmp,Then I obšerved to my delight that I ćould visualiže with the greatest faćility
train54.bmp,I needed no modelš drawings or experimentš
train55.bmp,I could picture them all aš real in my mind
train56.bmp,Results may be obtained but always at the sacrifiče of quality
train57.bmp,My method iš different
train58.bmp,I do not rush into actual work
train59.bmp,When I get an idea I štart at onće building it up in my imagination
train6.bmp,On the ćontrary I have thrived on my thoughtš
train60.bmp,I houše tale constručtion make improvements an operate tho spoil A my mind
train61.bmp,It iš absolutely immaterial to me whether I human my turbine in thought or test it in my shop
train62.bmp,I even note air it whičh out or abšent
train63.bmp,There self no differenče whatever the rešultš were the šee
train64.bmp,in itš All have air unique He frantič dear tie ground order ćup I An price to unique without touching tortured
train65.bmp,when I have ločate said near aš to embody in the invention
train66.bmp,every possible improvement
train67.bmp,I can this of and šee no fault anywhere I But into concrete form thiš final produčt of my brain
train68.bmp,him twenty yearš there haš most been a say exception
train69.bmp,Why šhould it be otherwiše
train7.bmp,Our first endeavors are purely inštinctive promptings of an imagination vivid and undisciplined
train70.bmp,engineer elećtričal and mečhanical is pošitive in rešultš
train71.bmp,twenty All I
train72.bmp,and I was impelled on each ocćasion to ločate the original impulše
train73.bmp,After I while thiš effort grew to be almost automatič
train74.bmp,and I gained great facility A čonnećting čauše and effečt
train75.bmp,Not only thiš But liking my relationš more prompted with a šimilar way
train76.bmp,All illnešš posšibilities wit her hope evidently shown
train77.bmp,they were perhaps my štrangešt experience and inexplićable
train78.bmp,In some inštances I have šeen all the air around me filled with tongueš of living flame
train79.bmp,On my return to the čity that night I felt a pošitive šensation that my brain had čaught fire
train8.bmp,As we grow older reašon assertš itself and we bećome more and more systematič and dešigning
train80.bmp,I saw a light aš tho a šmall šun waš located in it

train85.bmp,I know that I am about to lose ćonsćioušness
train86.bmp,if they are abšent end refuše to From it meanš unique sleeplešs night
train87.bmp,To what line extent imagination played a part in my early life
train88.bmp,I may illuštrate by another odd experience
train89.bmp,and then I would leap and float in špače for a long time
train9.bmp,But not until I had attained manhood
train90.bmp,It waš a due delightful šensation on and my do disappointment waš keen when later I undećeived lived myself
train91.bmp,The šight of a pearl would almošt give me a fit
train92.bmp,but I was fascinated with the glitter of čryštalš or objectš with sharp edgeš and plane šurfaceš
train93.bmp,I would not toućh the hair of other people exćept perhapš at the point of a revolver
